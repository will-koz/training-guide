# Training Guide

Found a great training guide from the Navy Seals for training. Most of the guide is just tables that
I thought should be automated to make a seemingly curated viewing experience. The guide can be found
at [SWCC GUIDE](https://www.sealswcc.com/training/navy-seal-swcc-physical-training-guide.html).
